* All that programming languages are, is a system of data manipulation rules
* Through Begriffsschrift, Frege attempted to show that mathematics grows out of logic. It introduced a rigorous treatment of functions and variables, invented axiomatic predicate logic, an improvement on stoic
propositional logic
* Lambda calculus - any function on numbers computable by a machine could be represented by a lambda term, built using only lambda abstraction (λx. t), function application
                    (t(u)), and variables (x), plus the notion of reduction ((λx. t)(u) ⇒ t[u/x])
    * Reduction rule : Employs substitution (λx. t)(u) ⇒ t[u/x]
    * The order in of reduction doesnt matter
    * Uses the idea from Frege/Schönfinkel : a function with two(many) arguments can be represented by a function with first argument which returns a function that takes the second argument
    * A function can also take other functions and return a function
    * The calculus can be extended with other rule for reduction
    * Numbers, arithmetic operations, recursion, conditionals, pairs can be represented
